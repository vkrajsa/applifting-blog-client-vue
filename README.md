# applifting blog in vue

## Live demo

```

```

## Goals that I set for myself to accomplish

- Build the app with Vue.js options API with all features.
- Experiment with Composition API and rewrie at least one component to Composition API.
- Integrate Typescript with Vue 3 and lose typescript virginity (since its my first exposure, I will limit myself to use the basic Types and experiment along the way).
- Write unit test for most critical features and try E2E testing with Cypress
- If there is extra time (Already I feel there won't be enough), I would try to convert the project to Nuxt.js. Something that would make sense to do from the start since blog should be SEO friendly and some pre rendering needs to happen. Learning new framework would be bit of a strech now so I keep it as very optional.
